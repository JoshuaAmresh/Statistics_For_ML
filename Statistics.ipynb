    "- Also as advised by Goura, when selecting features, make sure they follow central limit theorem, which according to me mean that the data distribution for the training and the prediction should be the same. Example, take the account tenure. I had some negative values, so for the training, the sample mean and S.D will be one. Whereas in the prod, there will be no negatives. So there the sample means and S.D will be different. So, avoid this type of errors in future projects. Always think about the same type of availability in prod while taking data for a feature"

    "The above solution is on the scenario when the population standard deviation is given. We took a sample size n of 30 and it's mean (sample mean or point estimate) is 500. Using the CI formula as shown above we can calculate the confidence interval where the population mean will lie. On margin error, when population S.D is not given, we need to use t test instead of Z test. Alpha in margin error is nothing but the signifance value (p value). We are calculating with confidence interval of 95%. So the alpha we are taking as 5% which is margin of error. Z(0.025) is same as 1-0.025. As the total curve of distribution is 1, we use 1- as formula for Z(0.025). The result is 0.975, for which we use Z-table to get the value 1.96 from. In the Z-table the 0.975 is located inside the matrix and we use the border values to get the number 1.96. As a result to the interviewer, we can say that with a confidence interval of 95% the population mean will lie between 386 and 613."
